	<br>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">“What’s in The photo?” uses a hands-on, practical approach that goes the extra step beyond theory work.
		Instead of poring over textbooks or skimming articles for hours, you can learn how Machine Learning (ML) works by training and testing your very own image-identifying ML models!<br><br>
		<strong><U>So what does this mean?</U></strong><br>
		What's in the photo? is designed to allow you to train your own image classification models and run them right here on the website! Simply navigate to the models page and click the 'Add model' button to get started. Give it a name and upload your data set (The more images the better, go nuts, give it thousands to increase the accuracy) and away you go!<br>
		Your data set should focus on one object, for example, if I upload 1000 images of a teacup the model will train itself to understand what a teacup looks like. If you're short on images don't worry, simply select to pull in images from the web and it will scrape Google for you!<br><br>
		Training a model can take a significant amount of time (hours depending on how many images you've given it to work with). So we have added some pre-trained models to get you started.<br><br>
		<strong><u>TensorFlow</u></strong><br>
		If you've ever looked into ML in the past, the chances are that you've come across the term TensorFlow. So what is it?
		TensorFlow is an open source framework for ML that uses the Python programming language. It makes getting into ML accessible to everyone and easier than ever!<br>
		Since TensorFlow is open source, it has a wide array of libraries available to help you achieve your goals. What's in the photo? Makes use of this by developing it's core system on the Keras library
